# graphing-app

## This is an app that helps you draw graphs from any kind of equation

## Description

You know back in school where they would give you an equation and tell you to interpret it as a line graph, well this app helps you to draw a graph (or graphs) for any equation i.e. be it simple, quadratic, cubic, and so forth. 

I built this project because of when I was a student, I used to have a problem drawing accurate line graphs for my lab projects and couldn't find a tool that meant my needs. I now later decided to build a simple tool so other wouldn't have to go through the same problem.

## How to use the app(Demo)

Here is a short demo video on how to use the deployed app- forgive me for the audio quality

## Features

- **Tabs**: Anytime you create a new graphsheet a different tab with the name of the graphsheet is also created. You can navigate to a different graphsheet by clicking on the corresponding tab

- **Changing line & graphsheet name**: You can change the name of the graphsheet or line by double clicking on the name. An input box wil appear which you can then type any custom name you like. The new name will also reflect on the corresponding tab or drawn graph
